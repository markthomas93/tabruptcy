### What is?

Tabruptcy is a Chrome extension which creates a list of all open tabs


### Explain again, but this time like a radio announcer.

Are you buried in tabs? Windows overflowing with news stories, blog entries, pictures of cats and other seemingly fascinating ephemera? Feel like you'll never escape, and the walls are closing in? Do you have 100, 200 or even 500 open tabs RIGHT NOW?

There is escape! Declare Tabruptcy.
