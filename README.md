## What is?

Are you buried in tabs? Windows overflowing with news stories, blog entries, pictures of cats and other seemingly fascinating ephemera? Feel like you'll never escape, and the walls are closing in? Do you have 100, 200 or even 500 open tabs RIGHT NOW?

There is escape! Declare Tabruptcy.


## To do
- Template JS
- Tab Screenshots
- Control: All tabs? Tabs from this window?
- Pretty-ier!
